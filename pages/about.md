# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Leveraging over 20 years of expertise in IT infrastructure and back-end engineering, I'm now channeling my passion for cutting-edge technology towards the AI revolution. As a certified Google Cloud Architect and Kubernetes aficionado, I build robust, scalable systems ready for the demands of intelligent applications. While I'm a versatile polyglot programmer with deep experience in languages like Go and JS, my primary focus and excitement are now centered on fully immersing myself in AI development and exploring its transformative potential. I'm a highly motivated, results-driven innovator, eager to apply my problem-solving skills to build next-generation AI solutions.
